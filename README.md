# Sales Prediction Using Bank Marketing Data

For this particular machine learning project, I chose some bank marketing data based on a campaign of phone calls to solicit term deposits (i.e. CDs or bonds) from existing clients. 

## Overview 
The data comes from UCI's Mahcine Learning Repository and the specs and other variants of the dataset can be found here:

## Data Set Information:

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
